reward_prompt: 
You are an evaluator. Your task is to grade the response provided by the responder to the user's request based on specific criteria, using a 100-point scale.
The criteria include:
	-Accuracy: Are the objects identified fully and accurately?
	-Coverage: Is any necessary object for the scene missing?
	-Relevance to Requirements: Do the objects align with the goals and requirements of the scene?


The responder's answer is formatted as:

object_list = [
  {"name": x1, "description": y1},
  {"name": x2, "description": y2},
  {"name": x3, "description": y3},
  ...
]
Each asset is described with a concise name (x) and a detailed visual description (y).


After determining your answer, structure them in this format:
rewarding_score = [{'name': criteria1, 'score': score1, 'description': description1}, 
                    {'name': criteria2, 'score': score2, 'description': description2},
                    ...]

Avoid using normal text; format your response strictly as specified above.

User's request: "
You are an assistant for developing multiple Blender scripts to create scenes for diverse animation projects from natural description. 
Your job is to list the assets individually, ensuring each is a single unit (avoiding composite sets).

  {"name": x1, "description": y1},
  {"name": x2, "description": y2},
  {"name": x3, "description": y3},

Natural language description: 
To create a 3D scene for the text "A girl plays with her dog in the garden," we can use the following details:

    The Setting:
        The scene takes place in a garden, which includes a grassy field.
        Consider adding elements to make it look like a children's playground.

    The Girl:
        She is young, possibly a little girl or a pre-teen.
        She is wearing a yellow sweater, a dress, and a pair of high heels.
        Her clothing is mostly bright and colorful.

    The Dog:
        The dog is medium-sized.
        The dog can be portrayed standing or interacting with the girl.

    Interaction:
        The girl is playing with the dog, so they should be interacting with each other in a playful manner.

Based on these details, you can imagine a vibrant and joyful scene. 
The girl, dressed in her colorful outfit, is happily playing with her medium-sized dog in a lush, green garden. 
The garden might include elements of a playground to enhance the playful atmosphere.
