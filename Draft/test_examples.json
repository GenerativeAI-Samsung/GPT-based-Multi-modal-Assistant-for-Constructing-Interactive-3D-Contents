Consider including small rocks or benches along the route to enhance the park feel.\n\n4. **Atmospheric Sound**: \n   - Incorporate ambient sounds such as soft footsteps, distant birds chirping, and the rustle of leaves to immerse viewers in the scene.\n\n**Camera Angles**:\n- Start with a wide shot to capture the entire park, then transition to closer shots of the joggers and the fog interacting with the trees.\n- Consider a slow pan along the path to emphasize the winding nature of the route.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The scene should evoke a sense of tranquility and motion, inviting viewers to feel the coolness of the fog and the energy of the joggers as they navigate through this serene park.\n\n---\n\nFeel free to adjust any details or elements in this script to better fit your vision for the 3D scene!",
